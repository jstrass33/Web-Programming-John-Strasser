    <p style="color: black;">Hello! My name is John. I am the youngest of 4 siblings and grew up towards the south-east side of stark county. I graduated from the University of Akron with a bachelor's in computer networking and currently work as a network enginner for The J.M. Smucker Company. Starting this summer, I began taking classes at Kent State for an MA in Computer Science. Below is a list of some of my hobbies.</p>
